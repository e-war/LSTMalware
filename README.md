![Beholder LSTM Logo](https://github.com/e-war/LSTMalware/blob/main/images/header.gif?raw=true)

## What is it?
A LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model + dataset. Utilises the procmon logging system to determine malicious process activity in the form of binary classification [malicious/benign]. Created for my University final project. 


## What do i need?
The program requires procmon logs in .csv format, the headings "Process Name","Image Path","Operation","Path","Result","Detail","Duration","TID" must be included and should be in cronological order.

Python requirements:
- tensorflow
- keras
- numpy
- sklearn
- csv

Todo:
- create `requirements.txt` file
- seperate training / dataset processing 
- Allow saving of processed datasets
